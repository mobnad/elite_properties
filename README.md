# Elite Properties 
// The Elite Properties website is a venue for showcasing opulent homes, offering visitors a sophisticated and user-friendly interface for perusing, searching, and exploring listings for luxury homes. i chose to create the website based on properties as many people are struggling to actually find good accomodation in london and due to that struggle and with my personal experience i found this as huge problem and decided on working on this project.

# OVERVIEW 
The website for Elite Properties is designed to be both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. Along with viewing property details and photos, visitors can also ask questions about their interests and access an extensive listing of exclusive homes. i have used chakra UI to create this website . the search filter has been embedded on the website as well to filter out different requirements based on the user needs based on the location , pricings and many other features. the properties page has got all the property listings with all the details of the properties individually. the website even got a contact us page where the user can contacts us regarding any enquiery and the website even has another form where the user can fill it to actually list his/her property on our website.  
# FEATURES 
1. property listing
2. property details
3. enquiry and contact
4. dark mode
5. search filter 

# problems faced 
- i tried to fix the images for each property listing on the properties page but unfortunately it didnt work out for me and i didnt have enough time to fix the issue . so on the properties page all the listings have the same image. i tried to fix that with imahge links but doing it individually would taken me loads of time as it has almost 108 property listings. 
- initially the home page was supposed to be page with 9 cards in it but then to make it look different from the properties page i separated the properties with some headings such as christmas deals, cheap properties etc.
- the website is responsive but i wouldnt say a 100 percent but almost 90 percent its responsive.
- the chakra ui was not so user friendly while creating the website as most of the stuff was paid .
- i wanted to create heading with diffrent font style on the home page to make it look appealing but due to the time constraints couldnt really work on it 
 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
